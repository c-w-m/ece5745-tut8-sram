ECE 5745 Tutorial 8: SRAM Generators
==========================================================================

* [cornell-ece5745/ece5745-tut8-sram](https://github.com/cornell-ece5745/ece5745-tut8-sram)

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Tutorial
8 on SRAM generators. The tutorial describes how to use both the OpenRAM
memory generator to generate actual layout as well as how to use a CACTI
memory generator to generate larger SRAMs that better match the needs of
this course. The tutorial explains how to use SRAMs in your RTL, how to
generate the corresponding SRAM macros, and then how to push a design
which uses these macros through the ASIC toolflow.
